Table Search client side

This repository is a proof of concept project we did do display a big table that can be queried with Jquery on the client side (browser).

A working example can be seen here:

[Ph balance data of shampoos](https://www.botoxforhair.net/blog/shampoos-ph-levels-list-database/). Database list that shows pH balanced hair products, low ph hair shampoos, and neutral pH shampoos
